00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Prudence The Power of holding back. Have you

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,300
ever said something you wish you hadn't or

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,000
acted in a way that left you feeling

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,700
unbalanced. Maybe you even made a decision that

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,600
simply didn't go your way. After moments like

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,500
these the words, you regret the actions that

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,700
unsettle, you the choices that don't land. You

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,400
might feel estranged. Discomfort Something inside, you feels

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,300
off that quiet voice in your mind. The

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,300
1 that stirs when something isn't right? That

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,900
is your conscience, believe it or not that

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,500
voice exists to guide you. It speaks up

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,300
when you've crossed the line or when you

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,700
could have done better. But here's the real

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,500
question, can we shut it down? Can we

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,700
ignore that inner discomfort and live without the

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,200
emotional aftermath? the truth is no, that voice,

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,800
the 1, that questions that reminds We'll never

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,300
fully disappear. But here's the good news, you

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,100
can manage it, it takes practice but it's

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,400
completely within your reach. Think about this. Have

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,800
you ever held your tongue when you really

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,800
wanted to give your opinion? That exact moment

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,300
when you're burning to speak, is the perfect

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,800
moment to practice prudence. It's the moment where

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,800
you choose do I say what I feel.

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,200
Or do I pause and think, before crossing

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,000
a line? Holding back isn't easy, but Prudence

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,800
doesn't mean staying silent forever, it doesn't mean

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,000
avoiding every hard situation. It means choosing the

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,500
right words, the right timing, and the right

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,100
attitude, It helps you act, not simply react,

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,600
a comment thrown in Anger a rushed decision.

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,100
A careless judgement, these things can cause real

35
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,400
damage. So when that emotional wave Rises inside,

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,700
you anger, Pride anxiety? Whatever it is. Take

37
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,300
a moment. Pause. Let the first impulse pass,

38
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,800
then make your choice and it will almost

39
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,800
always be the wiser 1. Before you speak

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,800
or act, there are usually 2, internal responses.

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,800
The first is raw emotion fast. Unfiltered impulsive,

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,700
the second is intentional, the version of you

43
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,699
that considers the impact of your words and

44
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,900
actions. Prudence won't make you the loudest voice

45
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,800
in the room, but it might make you

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,900
the 1 people remember when the noise fades,

47
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,200
It's not weakness, it's not fear. Its strength,

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,100
the strength to delay. The explosion to ask

49
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,800
yourself, what kind of echo you want to

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,700
leave behind. In a world addicted to instant

51
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,800
reactions. Prudence is a quiet. Form of rebellion,

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,800
the kinds that builds character instead of Chaos.

53
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,100
So, next time you're on the edge of

54
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,500
speaking, too soon or acting too fast. Don't

55
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,800
just hold back, take command because real power

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,600
isn't in doing what feels good in the

57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,400
moment. Real power is knowing you could act

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,000
on impulse and choosing to rise above it.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,300
So tell me in what areas of your

60
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,500
life could you start practicing Prudence today?
