00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Prudence The Power of holding back. Have you

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,200
ever said something you wish you hadn't? Or

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,100
acted in a way that left you feeling

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,200
unbalanced. Maybe you even made a decision that

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,200
simply didn't go your way. After moments like

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,800
these the words, you regret the actions that

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,000
unsettle, you the choices that don't land, you

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,600
might feel a strange discomfort. Something inside, you

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,400
feels off that quiet voice in your mind.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,700
The 1 that stirs when something isn't right?

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,600
That is your conscience. Believe it or not

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,300
that voice exists to guide you, it speaks

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,500
up when you've crossed a line or when

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,300
you could have done better. But here's the

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,200
real question. Can we shut it down? Can

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,200
we ignore that inner discomfort and live? Without

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,900
the emotional aftermath, the truth is know that

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,100
voice. The 1 that questions that reminds will

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,100
never fully disappear. But here's the good news,

20
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,099
you can manage it. It takes practice but

21
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,300
it's completely within your reach. Think about this.

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,900
Have you ever held your tongue when you

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,600
really wanted to give your opinion? That exact

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,300
moment when you're burning to speak? Is the

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,500
perfect moment to practice Prudence? It's the moment

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,800
where you choose do I say what I

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,400
feel or do I pause and think, before

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,300
crossing a line Holding back isn't easy, but

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,600
Prudence doesn't mean staying silent forever. It doesn't

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,200
mean avoiding every hard situation. It means choosing

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,200
the right words, the right timing. And the

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,900
right attitude. It helps you act, not simply

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,100
react, a comment thrown in Anger, a rushed

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,100
decision, a careless judgment. These things can cause

35
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,900
real damage. So when that emotional wave Rises

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,900
inside, you anger, Pride anxiety, whatever it is.

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,800
Take a moment. Pause. Let the first impulse

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,700
pass. Then make your choice. And it will

39
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,500
almost always be the wise 1. Before you

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,200
speak or act. There are usually 2, internal

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,700
responses. The first is raw emotion. Fast. Unfiltered

42
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,200
impulsive. The second is intentional. The version of

43
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,300
you that considers the impact of your words

44
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,400
and actions. Prudence won't make you the loudest

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,100
voice in the but it might make you

46
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,200
the 1 people remember when the noise fades,

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,200
It's not weakness. It's not fear. Its strength.

48
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,400
The strength to delay, the explosion. To ask

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
yourself what kind of echo you want to

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,900
leave behind? In a world addicted to instant

51
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,600
reactions, Prudence is a quiet form of rebellion,

52
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,100
the kind that builds character in chaos. So,

53
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,500
next time you're on the edge of speaking

54
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,200
too soon. Or acting too fast. Don't just

55
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,000
hold back. Take command. Because real power isn't

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,600
in doing what? Feels good in the moment,

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,100
real power is knowing you could act on

58
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,800
impulse. And choose to rise above it. So,

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,100
tell me. In what areas of your life?

60
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,400
Could you start practicing Prudence today?
